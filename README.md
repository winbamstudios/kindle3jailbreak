# How to jailbreak Kindle 3 (Keyboard/3rd Generation)
I have a Kindle 3. I wanted to JB it, but kindlemodding.org was no help, so I found my own method.
I recommend using 7-Zip for the tar.xz files here, which you can get at https://7-zip.org. (Remember the hyphen!)
(THIS GUIDE IS FOR THE Kindle K3G. If you have the Wi-Fi only model, use the K3W file instead of K3G. This post does not account for the european K3GB, but you can check your serial for that and use the K3GB file instead.)

Step 1: Plug your Kindle 3 into your computer.
Step 2: Download the MKK files from [here.](https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/Touch/kindle-mkk-20141129-r18833.tar.xz)
Step 3: Extract it, then copy the file named "Update_mkk-20141129-k3g-B006_install.bin" (or k3w-B008 for Wi-Fi only model) to the root of your Kindle.
Step 4: Eject the Kindle from your computer.
Step 5: Press the Menu key, select Settings, and then press Menu again. Select "Update this device." Allow it to install the file.
Step 6: Plug the Kindle 3 back into your computer.
Step 7: Download the DevCerts update from [here.](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=215127&d=1745098511)
Step 8: Extract it, then copy the file named "Update-mkk-20250419-k3g-B006_keystore-install.bin" to the root of the Kindle. (once again, k3w-B008 for the Wi-Fi only model)
Step 9: Download legacy KUAL from [here.](https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/KUAL/KUAL-v2.7.37-gfcb45b5-20250419.tar.xz)
Step 10: Extract it, and then take KUAL-KDK-1.0.azw2, and copy it to the "documents" folder in the root of the Kindle.
Step 11: Eject the Kindle again.
Step 12: Reopen settings and update once more.
Step 13: Open KUAL, and then shove as much as you'd like into the "extensions" folder. Have fun!
